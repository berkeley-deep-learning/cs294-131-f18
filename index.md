## Course description

In recent years, deep learning has enabled huge progress in many domains
including computer vision, speech, NLP, and robotics. It has become the leading
solution for many tasks, from winning the ImageNet competition to winning at Go
against a world champion. This class is designed to help students develop a
deeper understanding of deep learning and explore new research directions and
applications of deep learning. It assumes that students already have a basic
understanding of deep learning. In particular, we will explore a selected list
of new, cutting-edge topics in deep learning, including new techniques and
architectures in deep learning, security and privacy issues in deep learning,
recent advances in the theoretical and systems aspects of deep learning, and new
application domains of deep learning such as autonomous driving.

## Class format and project

This is a lecture, discussion, and project oriented class. Each lecture will
focus on one of the topics, including a survey of the state-of-the-art in the
area and an in-depth discussion of the topic. Each week, students are expected
to complete reading assignments before class and participate actively in class
discussion.

Students will also form project groups (two to three people per group) and
complete a research-quality class project.

## Enrollment information

**For undergraduates**: Please note that this is a graduate-level class.
However, with instructors' permission, we do allow qualified undergraduate
students to be in the class. If you are an undergraduate student and would like
to enroll in the class, please fill out
[**this form**](https://goo.gl/forms/akShIRmDLmmlaiu92)
and come to the first lecture of the class. Qualified undergraduates will be
given instructor codes to be allowed to register for the class after the first
lecture of the class, subject to space availability.

If you have not received grades for some classes that you are currently enrolled
in, please choose **Currently Enrolled** and then update the form when you
receive your final grades. You may also be interested in [this
class](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jfc/DeepLearn.html), which is open to
undergraduates.

Students may enroll in this class for variable units.

* **1 unit:** Participate in reading assignments (including serving as discussion lead once).
* **3 units:** Both reading assignments and a project. Projects may fall into one of
  four categories:
  * Traditional Literature Review of a deep learning topic (e.g., literature review of deep dialogue systems)
  * Distill-like Literature Review of a deep learning topic (e.g., a Distill-like blog post illustrating different optimization techniques used in deep learning)
  * Reimplement research code and open source it
  * Conference level research project
* You **may not** take this class for **4 units**.

## Deadlines

* Reading assignment deadlines:
  * For students,
    * Submit questions by Friday noon
    * Vote on the poll of discussion questions by Saturday 11:59 pm
  * For discussion leads,
    * Send form to collect questions from students by Wednesday 11:59 pm
    * Summarize questions proposed by students to form the poll and send it by Friday 11:59 pm
    * Summarize the poll to generate a ranked & categorized discussion question list and send the list to teaching staff by Sunday 7pm
    * Answer all Piazza questions about the assigned readings, both the week
    before and the week after the lecture.

## Grading
* 20% class participation
* 25% weekly reading assignment
  * 10% discussion leads
  * 15% individual reading assignments
* 55% project

## Additional Notes
* For students who need computing resources for the class project, we recommend you to look into AWS educate program for students. You'll get 100 dollar's worth of sign up credit. Here's the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/apply/"> link </a>.
